# Projects import #

Time to download the code.

Depending on what project you'll be working on, you're gonna need:
  * the engine
  * the project


1. Start Eclipse

2. Right-click anywhere in the **Package Explorer** area:

3. In the dropdown menu, select **Import**, and in the dialog window select **SVN/Project from SVN** option and press **Next>**.

4. The next dialog **Checkout from SVN** presents a list of preconfigured SVN locations. Your list should be empty at this point. Check the **Create a new repository location** and press **Next>**

5. Paste the information about the repository:

![http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checkout_from_svn.jpg](http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checkout_from_svn.jpg)

You need to input your user name and password. The user name is the name of your **gmail** account up until the **@** character - i.e. my account address is **ptrochim@gmail.com**, so my user name is **ptrochim**.

The password is generated for each user on the project webpage. Here's where you can find it:

6. Press **Next>**, and another dialog will appear. It will ask you to select the project you want to checkout from the repository.

Select the engine project:

And press **Finish** - Eclipse will download the engine code for you.

7. Now, we need to download the project. For the time being let's assume you're working on the **Khaky Birds**. What you need to do is repeat the steps from 1 to 3, and in point 4 instead of selecting **Create a new repository location**, select **Use existing repository location** and select it from the list.

8. Now - repeat step 6, but select a different project:

![http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checking_out_the_game.jpg](http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checking_out_the_game.jpg)

And press **Finish** - Eclipse will download the game code for you.



**Enjoy**
